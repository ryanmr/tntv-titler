tntv-titler
===========

A tool to read through show notes to get appropriate titles based on remote markup.

This automated titling tool extracts:
- title tags and their contents
- h1 tags and their contents

While pages usually have a single title tag, frequently pages misuse h1 heading tags. The titler will automatically rank alternative h1 tags down in importance going down the given page.
