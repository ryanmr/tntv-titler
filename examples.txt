#Top News
Apple bought Beats (the headphone maker and the online streaming service) for about $3.2 billion, which is more than any single acquisition by Apple previously

The Wall Street Journal says that Beats Co-founders Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine will join Apple as senior executives

#News:
Good news for PCs, shipments are up 5% in Q1 2014 year over year

Sad news for not only Google, but possibly the entire industry: Oracle won its appeal and the verdict is - APIs are copyrightable

Do you remember App.net? We talked about it a long time ago (April 2013 most recently), and well, it’s not looking good - they say that App.net is profiable and self-sustatining, but there will no longer be any full time employees working on the service

#Phone/Carrier:
The Moto E. That’s probably what it will be called, because, E is For Everyone? The specs are pretty dismal (cutting much more from a Moto G would be pretty tough...)

ZTE is at it again, they’ve released another version of the ZTE Open, this time called the ZTE Open C, for just $100 on eBay (please note: John Gruber bought one, so should you)

#Google: // too much Google news this week (example of comments in headers)
Google might be planning to radically overhaul not only the mobile interface of its mobile apps (Gmail, specifically) through Project Hera, but also the web version too, which a similar aesthetic

There might be some Nexus devices headed our way for Google I/O or shortly thereafter, first, an HTC device code named “Flounder” (which has a hint of irony), and another device codenamed “Molly”; these names came from the ASOP changelog of Android 4.4.3

Google Now has had yet another addition: when you search for a product at a local store online, for example, on Target.com, Google Now will pop up a card reminding you that there’s a store nearby with the product you were previously looking at

Google and Intel held an event this week all about Chromebooks
http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/6/5687518/google-and-intel-team-up-to-give-chromebooks-more-power 
Coming later this summer, just in time for back to school, Acer and Dell will use i3-haswell chips in their Chromebooks
Google is also saying that new models will be coming soon with Bay Trail-M chips, and while they won’t be as fast as an i3, it will allegedly get 11 hours of battery life
A pretty underwhelming event, considering the Chromebooks didn’t actually “come out”
Oh, and Lenovo released details about July/August launching Chromebooks,

#Apple:
Apple is upgrading their PoS system at Apple stores from 4th generation (and sometimes earlier models in less popular stores) iPod touches, to iPhone 5S units; this will add RFID checking, chip & pin native capabilities and greatly stabilize the checkout processes
http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/09/apple-store-employees-switching-from-ipod-touch-to-iphone-5s-for-easypay-pos-system/ 
This weekend began a huge effort for Apple Retail Store trade-ins of old iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S units; Apple will offer a $99 and $199 credit on the trade-in of an iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S respectively towards the purchase of a 5S/C; Apple sent out emails to those people who were still unlucky enough to have an iPhone 4/S
http://9to5mac.com/2014/05/09/apple-kicks-off-its-big-in-store-iphone-upgrade-event/ 
Ari Partinen, a Senior Lumia Engineer with Nokia/Microsoft, has left, and has instead begun working at Apple, which could very well indicate some beyond normal pixel-counts coming down the line

#Microsoft:
Microsoft has invited the press to a Microsoft Surface Event on May 20th, and they say, “Join us for a small gathering”, alluding to the alleged 7.5’’ Surface coming soon

#Other:
Amazon is rolling out Sunday delivery to more cities, New York and LA launched last year, now you can get deliveries in 15 more cities, mostly southern cities
